How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   - using dropbox, git after uploading the file right click and version number

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   - When you've updated your document, click "Next" and Sarah will go over another 
	difference between version control systems.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	- using git log method to get the history of versions, then git diff method for finding the 
	difference followed by old version and new version code. Red's are deleted method and green's 
	are added method.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - git log command will illustrates the history of directory with it's code. And, git diff method 
	is used to show the difference between two files.
